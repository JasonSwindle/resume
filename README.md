# Resume

[![Update resume PDF on published release](https://github.com/JasonSwindle/resume/actions/workflows/release.yml/ci.yml.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/JasonSwindle/resume/actions/workflows/ci.yml.yml)

My resume, currently powered by LaTeX, but this could change as I find something new/better. PRs are welcomed!
